// This is a simplified conceptual outline. Actual implementation would involve:
// - Secure handling of payment tokens/details (e.g., using a third-party payment processor SDK like Stripe.js or Braintree SDK).
// - Robust error handling and logging for payment gateway interactions.
// - Database interactions to record payment success/failure and update invoice status.
// - Adherence to PCI DSS compliance if handling sensitive cardholder data directly.

// For the purpose of this exercise, we'll assume the actual payment processing logic
// is handled by the `PaymentService` and we are defining the API contract here.
